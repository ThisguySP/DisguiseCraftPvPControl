DisguiseCraftPvPControl
=======================

This simple Bukkit plugin breaks the DisguiseCraft disguise of a player who enters combat as either the attacker or attacked with any player or mob (thus slightly invalidating its name as a PvP-related plugin). Note that you will not find it on BukkitDev, as the much more feature-rich MobDisguisePvPControl is still maintained.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is a matter of only two options, both of which default to true: Whether to break the attacker's disguise, and whether to break the disguise of the attacked. Other than that, there are no permissions or configuration options as of this version and likely never will be unless they are requested. Simply drop the plugin into your plugins directory and start the server for the default experience, or reconfigure one to two of two options for a (negligibly) customized experience.
